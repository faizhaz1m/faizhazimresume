      <h3>BARISTA SECRET RECIPE</h3>
      <p>
        I worked as a barista at Secret Recipe, where I earned my own income and learned the value of financial independence. With the money I made, I was able to buy my own phone, which I consider one of my best investments because it supported both my studies and personal growth. This experience also introduced me to the basics of running a business for the first time, including customer service, teamwork, time management, and understanding how daily operations work in a real business environment.

      <h3>INTERN R2P</h3>
      <p>
        During my internship, I worked in Kuala Lumpur and commuted daily using public transportation, which helped me become more disciplined, independent, and responsible. This experience opened my eyes to the professional working world and gave me a clearer understanding of how businesses are structured and managed. I was able to observe real workplace dynamics, learn from professionals, and adapt to a fast-paced environment. Additionally, I met many new people from different backgrounds, which improved my communication skills and expanded my professional network.

      <h3>PART TIME BUSINESS ZAPOCOLLECTION</h3>
      <p>
        I also took part in a part-time business as an experiment to better understand entrepreneurship. Through trial and error, I learned what strategies worked and what did not, which helped me gain practical insight into managing a business. This experience allowed me to understand the challenges and responsibilities of running a business while still being a university student. At the same time, it enabled me to generate income during my university years, reinforcing my interest in business and strengthening my problem-solving and decision-making skills.
