        <p>I have skills in graphic design and video editing, with experience creating visual content for social media, presentations, and simple branding purposes. While I consider myself a slow learner at the beginning, I am consistent and dedicated, and over time I am able to fully understand and master the skills I am learning. I genuinely enjoy the learning process and am always open to gaining new knowledge, whether in academics, sports, or any skills that can benefit me in the long run. In addition to creative skills, I have knowledge of marketing and understand the importance of branding, audience engagement, and promotion. I have a strong interest in business and have always aspired to be involved in entrepreneurship, combining creativity and marketing to create meaningful and impactful work.</p>
